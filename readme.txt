This folder contains six jupyter notebooks that generate the plots associated with the figures stated in their filenames.

The notebooks read the files contained in the 'data' folder, which are left unmodified.

Each data subpanel of each figure is automatically generated by the jupyter notebooks as a pdf file in the 'figs' folder.
