This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks associated with the manuscript 'Addressable and adaptable intercellular communication via DNA messaging' by John Marken and Richard Murray (2023).

Each of the six jupyter notebooks will generate the plots associated with the figures stated in their filenames, as well as perform any fold-change calculations and statistical tests stated in the main text of the paper.

The notebooks read the files contained in the 'data' folder, which are left unmodified and should not be changed.

Each data subpanel of each figure is automatically generated by the jupyter notebooks as a pdf file in the 'figs' folder.
